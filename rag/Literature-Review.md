* LIT-1, "As a nurse in a urology clinic, I struggle with time-consuming documentation requirements for medication verification. Hence, I perform verbal verification checks with another nurse without registering them in the Hospital Information System (HIS), to save time while still maintaining the four-eyes principle."
* LIT-2, "As a hospital staff member responsible for taking patient measurements, I faced strict requirements to register results directly in the Hospital Information System (HIS) immediately after each measurement. However, this process was time-consuming and inefficient, especially during busy hours. Hence, I opted to take measurements from multiple patients in succession and then wrote the results down on a note before entering all the patient data into the HIS as a batch. This deviation allowed me to manage my workload more effectively, despite not following the prescribed protocol."

* LIT-3, "As a physician at ALPHA, I am required to use the hospital information system (HIS) to manage electronic health records (EHR). However, due to the constraints of the system and privacy policies, I often find it necessary to share EHR with colleagues outside of the hospital and copy them to my private devices. The challenge is that while I am aware of the risks and rules prohibiting this behavior, the demand for timely documentation and collaboration compels me to seek alternative methods. My goal is to ensure proper care and collaboration while managing the limitations imposed by the HIS."
* LIT-4, "As a busy physician, I find that during the day, I am unable to document my interactions with patients due to time constraints. To manage my workload, I copy electronic health records (EHR) to personal USB devices, so I can work on them from home after hours. This workaround allows me to maintain a work-life balance, as I can document my work while spending time with my family. Although this violates the hospital's privacy policy, the urgency of patient care documentation drives this behavior. To address the risks associated with EHR sharing, I utilize a feature known as the VIP flag within the HIS. This tool allows me to mark particularly sensitive patient records so that both I and my colleagues ensure those records remain within the hospital system. The challenge lies in balancing the urgency of documentation with the need for privacy. This workaround directly supports the goal of reducing privacy breaches while enabling efficient communication among physicians regarding sensitive information."
* LIT-5, "During my time as an engineer at BETA, I encountered a tedious requirement to log in and out of my workstation throughout the day. Instead, I opted to simply log in each morning and log out at the end of the day. This workaround allowed for greater efficiency in my workflow, although it did mean that my workstation was left vulnerable during the day, which raised security concerns from the IT department. My objective was to focus on my projects and streamline my access to necessary resources."
* LIT-6, "After new two-factor authentication measures were implemented at BETA, I discovered that a company ID card I had claimed as lost could still function as the second authentication factor in my PC. This realization made it feasible for me to bypass some of the security measures without being officially sanctioned and still use the new card for access control and in the cafeteria. While I understood the intention behind the security protocols, my focus on project deadlines led me to adopt this workaround. The main challenge is balancing security compliance with maintaining productivity."
* LIT-7, "To circumvent the two-factor authentication process at BETA, my colleagues and I discovered a tactic to break or cut our ID cards, rendering them nearly invisible during inspections. This tactic allowed us to leave our workstations unlocked without raising suspicion, as the IT team merely conducted visual checks for unattended ID cards. While this behavior carries risks, ensuring our productivity by avoiding the repeated login process was of higher priority for us."
