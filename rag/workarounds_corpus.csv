49,K14,"As a factory worker, I struggle with receiving tols from work preparation department during night shifts due to different working hours. Hence, I collect the material myself in case the tool suppliers are not working. ",
62,R23,"As a Senior Engineer Manufacturing Technology, I struggle with varying measurement precision of material thickness (nominal values vs. measured values with different precision), provided by our suppliers. Hence, I manually  maintain an Excel sheet that links these to the nomimal values to reduce the variety in stock and to always have an overview about total material in each thinkness group for fast access through others and optimal replenishment.",
63,K27,"As a production worker, when excess material remains after a production run and I need it in another line, I bypass the official return process and directly transfer the material to the required production line, to ensure that operations continue smoothly.",
64,K28,"As a factory worker, I sometimes struggle with delayed deliveries of Kanban materials. Since i cannot see if they are on the way already, I fetch them from the warehouse myself as a workaround, in order to prevent halting the production line. I tolerate, that I might end up with double the amount of material.",
65,K29,"As a logistics coordinator, I regularly struggle with material that is not delivered on time. This prevents a planned wave of required materials from getting released automatically. Since the system retries to release the wave only for 24 hours, I manually release all blocked waves every morning, to at lease provide the available material to the production lines.",
67,K31,"As a logistics worker, when there are no valid data for categorizing new materials in the new central warehouse, I automatically assign items to an A-B-C category. This should be classified automatically, but the automatism has no data in a new warehouse. The classification may be wrong, but it is mandatory to guarantee access to the material ",

72,K35,"As a materials handler, I struggle with the problem, that I sometimes must split received material to more than one storage box whereas our label printer only printed one barcode label. Hence I manually print additional labels using a form, resulting in more manual work during storage processes - unlabled storage would be unaccessible.",
77,K40,"As a worker, I struggle with missing material and a tight schedule. Hence I pick material, when I urgently need it, directly from a neighbouring production line, instead of ordering it via ERP system, in order to keep the production line running.",
78,K41,"As forklift operator, I frequently face a tight schedule and having to scan the location and material at the storage spot, which is time-consuming and disrupts my workflow. To circumvent this, I have placed commonly used barcodes inside the forklift, allowing me to scan them directly from there and save valuable time. My goal is to streamline the material handling.",
79,K42,"As a forklift operator in an extensive plant, when I see that the material booking slows down our workflow, I perform the booking during transport instead of waiting until I reach the packing station to ensure a smoother and faster process.",
80,K43,"As a logistics employee, when the standard process for picking parts is unsafe due to incomplete bills of material, I rely on my expertise and knowledge of the production line to efficiently select the typically required materials for each production line, ensuring we meet demand promptly without waiting for formal instructions.",

85,K48,"As a logistics manager, I occasionally encounter stock discrepancies. When time permits, I conduct impromptu inventory checks on specific items, despite our standard annual stocktaking procedure. This reduces uncertainty in our logistics flow, though it requires additional time investment.",
86,K49,"As a logistics coordinator, I recognise that daily operational challenges result in poorly maintained inventory records. Rather than using the planned sample-based inventory assessment, I conduct a comprehensive annual stock-take at the fiscal year-end to ensure accurate inventory levels. Though considerably more costly, this approach overcomes the limitations of our current inventory management system whilst preserving the flexibility my teams require.",
87,K50,"As a logistics worker, when strict FIFO (First-In-First-Out) practices lead to leftover stock being stored in different smaller containers instead of larger grid boxes, I adapt by consolidating mixed parts during restocking to maintain the FIFO principle as closely as possible.",

96,V1,"As a truck driver, when I am required to ensure cargo security (Ladungssicherungsgesetz), but face the challenge of not being allowed to leave my vehicle at high-security loading sites, I rely on my previous relationships with the loading personnel to trust their work, and when in doubt, I make an additional stop outside the shipping area to double-check the cargo security, even though it costs me valuable time.",
97,R25,"As a shipping employee, I sometimes create photo documentation based on my intuition for certain shipments when customers have special requirements (packaging regulations, labels from the customer's number range, etc.) or if there have been inquiries from the customer regarding the packaging in the past. This protects me against vague accusations from customers and safeguards the company against liability claims in the event of transport damage.",
98,R26,"As a shipping employee, I am sometimes confused by packaging specifications. My intuition for the right packaging feels better than the specification in the system. I then consult by email or phone on the spot to avoid damaged products (depending on the shipping route, product, and customer specification), save costs, and act sustainably (cardboard instead of wood).",
100,R28,"As a packaging worker, when our standard packaging solutions do not fit the products, I create custom packaging that meets our needs, ensuring that we can continue operations without significant delays.",

110,SEC-33,"As an IT administrator, I struggle with ensuring internet connectivity after a cyber attack. Hence, I've set up emergency internet access through LTE hotspots and StarLink to maintain access to the Internet, Teams, and SharePoint, despite facing challenging situations where, at one location, windows must remain open because their coating blocks wireless signals when closed, forcing staff to work in cold conditions.",
111,SEC-34,"As an IT administrator, I faced an unexpected incident that affected our systems. Hence, I repurposed newly purchased servers, which were originally intended for our company's AI project, to establish emergency operations that remained in place until mid-February. This delayed the start of the AI project, but it was necessary to ensure the company's operations continued without interruption.",
112,SEC-35,"As an IT administrator, during a cyber incident, I struggled with maintaining printing capabilities in a potentially compromised network segment. Hence, I set up individual computers as print stations by connecting printers via USB cables to ensure that purchasing, production, and administration departments could continue their work.",
113,SEC-36,"As CIO during a cyber incident, I struggled with managing both communication and technical tasks. Hence, I delegated communication tasks (internal news updates, incident information, appointment scheduling, external communications) to staff from other departments, allowing the IT team to focus on analysing the incident causes and restoring systems.",
114,LIT-1,"As a nurse in a urology clinic, I struggle with time-consuming documentation requirements for medication verification. Hence, I perform verbal verification checks with another nurse without registering them in the Hospital Information System (HIS), to save time while still maintaining the four-eyes principle.","van der Waal et al. (2022): The SWORD is Mightier than the Interview: A Framework for Semi-automatic WORkaround Detection, https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/423163/SWORD.pdf?sequence=1"
115,LIT-2,"As a hospital staff member responsible for taking patient measurements, I faced strict requirements to register results directly in the Hospital Information System (HIS) immediately after each measurement. However, this process was time-consuming and inefficient, especially during busy hours. Hence, I opted to take measurements from multiple patients in succession and then wrote the results down on a note before entering all the patient data into the HIS as a batch. This deviation allowed me to manage my workload more effectively, despite not following the prescribed protocol.","van der Waal et al. (2022): The SWORD is Mightier than the Interview: A Framework for Semi-automatic WORkaround Detection, https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/423163/SWORD.pdf?sequence=1"
116,LIT-3,"As a physician at ALPHA, I am required to use the hospital information system (HIS) to manage electronic health records (EHR). However, due to the constraints of the system and privacy policies, I often find it necessary to share EHR with colleagues outside of the hospital and copy them to my private devices. The challenge is that while I am aware of the risks and rules prohibiting this behavior, the demand for timely documentation and collaboration compels me to seek alternative methods. My goal is to ensure proper care and collaboration while managing the limitations imposed by the HIS.","Wiesche et al. (2024): Digital Desire Paths: Exploring the Role of Computer Workarounds in Emergent Information Systems Design, https://doi.org/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2313537"
117,LIT-4,"As a busy physician, I find that during the day, I am unable to document my interactions with patients due to time constraints. To manage my workload, I copy electronic health records (EHR) to personal USB devices, so I can work on them from home after hours. This workaround allows me to maintain a work-life balance, as I can document my work while spending time with my family. Although this violates the hospital's privacy policy, the urgency of patient care documentation drives this behavior. To address the risks associated with EHR sharing, I utilize a feature known as the VIP flag within the HIS. This tool allows me to mark particularly sensitive patient records so that both I and my colleagues ensure those records remain within the hospital system. The challenge lies in balancing the urgency of documentation with the need for privacy. This workaround directly supports the goal of reducing privacy breaches while enabling efficient communication among physicians regarding sensitive information.","Wiesche et al. (2024): Digital Desire Paths: Exploring the Role of Computer Workarounds in Emergent Information Systems Design, https://doi.org/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2313537"
118,LIT-5,"During my time as an engineer at BETA, I encountered a tedious requirement to log in and out of my workstation throughout the day. Instead, I opted to simply log in each morning and log out at the end of the day. This workaround allowed for greater efficiency in my workflow, although it did mean that my workstation was left vulnerable during the day, which raised security concerns from the IT department. My objective was to focus on my projects and streamline my access to necessary resources.","Wiesche et al. (2024): Digital Desire Paths: Exploring the Role of Computer Workarounds in Emergent Information Systems Design, https://doi.org/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2313537"
119,LIT-6,"After new two-factor authentication measures were implemented at BETA, I discovered that a company ID card I had claimed as lost could still function as the second authentication factor in my PC. This realization made it feasible for me to bypass some of the security measures without being officially sanctioned and still use the new card for access control and in the cafeteria. While I understood the intention behind the security protocols, my focus on project deadlines led me to adopt this workaround. The main challenge is balancing security compliance with maintaining productivity.","Wiesche et al. (2024): Digital Desire Paths: Exploring the Role of Computer Workarounds in Emergent Information Systems Design, https://doi.org/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2313537"
120,LIT-7,"To circumvent the two-factor authentication process at BETA, my colleagues and I discovered a tactic to break or cut our ID cards, rendering them nearly invisible during inspections. This tactic allowed us to leave our workstations unlocked without raising suspicion, as the IT team merely conducted visual checks for unattended ID cards. While this behavior carries risks, ensuring our productivity by avoiding the repeated login process was of higher priority for us.","Wiesche et al. (2024): Digital Desire Paths: Exploring the Role of Computer Workarounds in Emergent Information Systems Design, https://doi.org/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2313537"
121,LIT-8,"As an ERP system user, I struggle with the perceived inflexibility of the system, which often does not accommodate my specific needs for data entry. Hence, I tweak the system by using the statistical code field, originally intended for capturing statistical data, to input credit card payment information. This allows me to work around the system's limitations in order to effectively record payment details that are crucial for processing transactions.","Boudreau, M.C., and D. Robey (2005) “Enacting Integrated Information Technology: A Human Agency Perspective”, Organization Science, (16), pp. 3–18."
122,LIT-9,"As a call center operator in insurance sales, I struggle with the lengthy data entry process required before I can provide quotes for insurance premium costs. Hence, I enter dummy data to move through the system faster in order to quickly obtain the required information for my customers.","Lederman, R., G. Shanks, and M.R. Gibbs (2003) “Meeting Privacy Obligations: The Implications for Information Systems Development”, ECIS 2003 Proceedings, Paper 96."
123,LIT-10,"As a licensed staff member, I notice that when confronted with the issue of excessive dosing, I often enter multiple doses of the same medication into the computerized order entry system to fulfill the full ordered dose instead of discussing the situation with the pharmacist or physician. This helps me avoid delays in patient care and ensures that the patient receives the required medication promptly.","Vogelsmeier, A.A., J.R.B. Halbesleben, and J.R. Scott-Cawiezell (2008) “Technology Implementation and Workarounds in the Nursing Home”, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, (15), pp. 114-119"
124,LIT-11,"As a hotel manager, I struggle with the restrictive Internet bandwidth policy that limits email attachments to 2 or 4 MB and blocks access to social networking capabilities, making it difficult to connect with customers and maintain relationships outside of the hotel. Hence, I use mobile devices to access more powerful networks intended for guests in order to communicate effectively with clients and perform my job duties.","Davison, R.M., and C.X.J. Ou (2013) Sharing Knowledge in Technology Deficient Environments: Individual Workarounds Amid Corporate Restrictions, European Conference on Information Systems, Utrecht, Netherlands."
125,LIT-12,"As a marketing communication manager, I face challenges due to the restrictive bandwidth policy that impairs my ability to send larger email attachments and use social media for customer engagement. Hence, I pay for a virtual private network out of my own pocket to circumvent these limitations, with the tacit support of my immediate boss and the hotel’s general manager, allowing me to efficiently manage customer communications from home.","Davison, R.M., and C.X.J. Ou (2013) Sharing Knowledge in Technology Deficient Environments: Individual Workarounds Amid Corporate Restrictions, European Conference on Information Systems, Utrecht, Netherlands."
126,LIT-14,"As a senior enlisted leader on the littoral combat ship Manchester, I struggle with the limited internet access available to my crew, which hampers their ability to stay connected with family and friends during deployment. Hence, I conspire with my fellow chiefs to secretly install an unauthorized Wi-Fi network aboard the ship, using a Starlink satellite internet dish to create a private network dubbed 'STINKY', allowing us to check sports scores, text home, and stream movies","https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2024/09/03/how-navy-chiefs-conspired-to-get-themselves-illegal-warship-wi-fi/"
127,LIT-17,"As a control room operater in a nuclear power plant, I ensure active cooling, to remove the heat generated by radioactive decay. For a planned reactor shutdown, back up diesel generators were designed to start up automatically in order to provide power to the instruments and main water circulation pumps, however they took over 60 seconds to reach full speed. Too long for the core to be without cooling. It was suggested that the steam turbines, which would continue to spin after a reactor shutdown, might generate enough electrical power as they were coasting down to run the main water circulation pumps while the back-up diesel generators were winding up, elegantly bridging the power gap and allowing us to maintain reasonable core temperatures.","Chernobyl – 30 years on, Loss Prevention Bulletin 251 October 2016"
