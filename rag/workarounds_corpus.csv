0,R1,"As a production engineer, I struggle with time pressure. Hence, I book used material afterwards in batch in the IT system to avoid peak times. "
1,R2,"As a production engineer, I struggle with time pressure and access to machinery urgent rush orders. Hence, I produce and store some more half finished parts along with other orders, to be prepared for rush orders and keep response times low."
2,R3,"As a machine operator, I struggle because of formal overhead in official stock-keeping regarding half finished parts. Hence, I keep my half finished parts in my personal storage area, in order to avoid the overhead for small quantities."
16,R8,"As a production engineer, I struggle with the uncertain number of products needed for destructive quality tests, i.e. if a test goes wrong or the customer demands additional external tests. Hence, I produce additional spare products to cover for potentially needed extra tests."
17,R9,"As a factory worker, I am confronted with the time pressure of a high priority Rush Order for spare parts. Hence, I 'steal' parts that were planned to be used in other orders to keep response times of rush orders fast."
19,R11,"As a sales representative I struggle to express the orientation of a rupture disc in the proAlpha ERP system, since there is no dedicated field in the form. Hence, I define the required burst pressure as a negative value in order to communicate a reversed orientation of a rupture disc to the machine operators."
25,R15,"As a factory worker, I struggle with the time pressure of an order. Hence, I start the packaging process before the product is ready to save time in the last steps of the process."
26,CWA-284,"As a procurement manager I struggle with many agreements and subsequent corrections. Hence, I do not document the RFQ Process in SAP to save time. "
28,CWA-285,"As a procurement manager, I struggle to estimate the value of a service in advance. Hence, I only register the value of the service when the corresponding invoice is received to avoid subsequent corrections. "
31,R18,"As a QA manager, I struggle with a missing possibility to assign a batch number before starting to work on an order. Hence, I must start QA process before production, to assign the batch number."
34,R21,"As a factory worker, I struggle with the requirements of the proAlpha ERP system to work on different steps of the production process. Hence, I declare an order as finished before the quality insurance has taken place, to be able to start the following processes in proAlpha"
35,R22,"As a factory worker, I struggle with missing rights to print barcode labels for boxes. Hence, I ask my colleague from QA departement to do so. This will set status to production start and this colleague must ask a further colleague from quality processing departement, to set set status to production finished."
36,K1,"As a logistican, I struggle with incomplete work plans and items lists. Hence, I rely on my own experience / knowledge to fulfil the requirements in my production line. "
37,K2,"As a factory worker, I struggle with missing parts for my production step. Hence, I vocally call out for a logistics worker to get the needed parts as soon as possible."
41,K6,"As a production worker, when the personnel deployment planning tool is unsuitable for our needs, I utilize Excel for planning instead, allowing for a more flexible and familiar approach to managing staff assignments."
45,K10,"As an assembly line worker, I struggle with time pressure. Hence, I use every free time for pre-producing half-finished parts to use them, when pressure is high, knowing that this will result in trouble in stock keeping, because of missing part number for these half-finished parts."
49,K14,"As a factory worker, I struggle with receiving tols from work preparation department during night shifts due to different working hours. Hence, I collect the material myself in case the tool suppliers are not working. "
62,R23,"As a Senior Engineer Manufacturing Technology, I struggle with varying measurement precision of material thickness (nominal values vs. measured values with different precision), provided by our suppliers. Hence, I manually  maintain an Excel sheet that links these to the nomimal values to reduce the variety in stock and to always have an overview about total material in each thinkness group for fast access through others and optimal replenishment."
63,K27,"As a production worker, when excess material remains after a production run and I need it in another line, I bypass the official return process and directly transfer the material to the required production line, to ensure that operations continue smoothly."
64,K28,"As a factory worker, I sometimes struggle with delayed deliveries of Kanban materials. Since i cannot see if they are on the way already, I fetch them from the warehouse myself as a workaround, in order to prevent halting the production line. I tolerate, that I might end up with double the amount of material."
65,K29,"As a logistics coordinator, I regularly struggle with material that is not delivered on time. This prevents a planned wave of required materials from getting released automatically. Since the system retries to release the wave only for 24 hours, I manually release all blocked waves every morning, to at lease provide the available material to the production lines."
67,K31,"As a logistics worker, when there are no valid data for categorizing new materials in the new central warehouse, I automatically assign items to an A-B-C category. This should be classified automatically, but the automatism has no data in a new warehouse. The classification may be wrong, but it is mandatory to guarantee access to the material" 
70,K34,"As a goods receiving employee, I struggle with malfunctions of the scale connected to our ERP system. Hence, I rely on a manual scale to weigh items and manually transfer the measured quantities to maintain my workflow, despite the extra workload."
71,R24,"As a customer, I struggle with extended delivery times of up to 8 weeks during peak periods. Hence, I place my order as a rush order, accepting the price increase in order to receive my items within 4 weeks."
72,K35,"As a materials handler, I struggle with the problem, that I sometimes must split received material to more than one storage box whereas our label printer only printed one barcode label. Hence I manually print additional labels using a form, resulting in more manual work during storage processes - unlabled storage would be unaccessible."
77,K40,"As a worker, I struggle with missing material and a tight schedule. Hence I pick material, urgently needed, directly from a neighbouring production line, instead of ordering it via ERP system, in order to keep the production line running."
78,K41,"As a logistican, I frequently face a tight schedule and having to scan the location and material at the storage spot, which is time-consuming and disrupts my workflow. To circumvent this, I have placed commonly used barcodes inside the forklift, allowing me to scan them directly from there and save valuable time. My goal is to streamline the material handling."
79,K42,"As a forklift operator in an extensive plant, when I see that the material booking slows down our workflow, I perform the booking during transport instead of waiting until I reach the packing station to ensure a smoother and faster process."
80,K43,"As a logistics employee, when the standard process for picking parts is unsafe due to incomplete bills of material, I rely on my expertise and knowledge of the production line to efficiently select the typically required materials for each production line, ensuring we meet demand promptly without waiting for formal instructions."
82,K45,"As a logistics worker, when facing limited storage space on site, I utilise smaller carts to maximise space efficiency, despite this leading to greater effort during picking and transport operations."
83,K46,"As a logistics worker, when I encounter a shortage of proper containers during the picking process of Kanban materials, I temporarily store materials directly instead of repacking, which allows me to maintain workflow efficiency despite the constraints."
84,K47,"As a logistics worker, when I need to acknowledge a new storage location that doubles as a transport cart, I input the exception code into the system despite it offering no added value, to ensure I can complete the process efficiently."
85,K48,"As a logistican, I am sometimes confronted with inconsistencies in stocks. If I have the time, I take inventory of the specific item although we usually only take inventory once a year. Thereby, I reduce uncertainty in the flow of logistics, at the price of additional time invested."
86,K49,"As a logistics coordinator at, when I notice that our inventory records are poorly maintained, I conduct a comprehensive annual stock-taking at the end of the fiscal year to ensure accurate inventory levels, which helps overcome the limitations of our current inventory management system."
87,K50,"As a logistics worker, when strict FIFO (First-In-First-Out) practices lead to leftover stock being stored in different containers like boxes instead of grid boxes, I adapt by consolidating mixed parts during restocking to maintain the FIFO principle as closely as possible."
88,K51,"As a logistics worker, when I need to print the large shipping documents and can only use the fixed printer, I walk to the designated printing area, ensuring I complete multiple documents in one trip to minimize extra walking and waiting times."
89,K52,"As a logistics worker, when I encounter issues with using the wrong printers, I scan the barcodes attached to the printers to ensure I am selecting the correct one, thereby reducing the risk of errors and increasing operational efficiency."
90,K53,"As a logistics worker, when the manual consolidation process is not driven by a systematic approach but rather initiated ad-hoc based on evaluations from the warehouse control station, I proactively adjust the inventory allocation by improvising solutions to ensure efficient operations alongside the existing Fast Repack App logic."
96,V1,"As a truck driver, when I am required to ensure cargo security but face the challenge of not being able to leave my vehicle at high-security loading sites, I rely on my previous relationships with the loading personnel to trust their work, and when in doubt, I make an additional stop outside the shipping area to double-check the cargo security, even though it costs me valuable time."
97,R25,"As a shipping employee, I sometimes create photo documentation based on my intuition for certain shipments when customers have special requirements (packaging regulations, labels from the customer's number range, etc.) or if there have been inquiries from the customer regarding the packaging in the past. This protects me against vague accusations from customers and safeguards the company against liability claims in the event of transport damage."
98,R26,"As a shipping employee, I am sometimes confused by packaging specifications. My intuition for the right packaging feels better than the specification in the system. I then consult by email or phone on the spot to avoid damaged products (depending on the shipping route, product, and customer specification), save costs, and act sustainably (cardboard instead of wood)."
100,R28,"As a packaging worker, when our standard packaging solutions do not fit the products, I leverage our established improvisation process to create custom packaging that meets our needs, ensuring that we can continue operations without significant delays."
101,R29,"As a warehouse worker, when I notice that the storage space for packaged goods is insufficient during peak times, I spontaneously use the sluice as an interim storage solution to manage space and ensure smooth operations until a more formal process is established."
104,R32,"As a QA team member, when the current project planning and documentation processes are cumbersome and prone to errors due to manual data entry in Excel, I switch to collecting and sharing project updates in a more informal, collaborative manner with stakeholders across different departments to ensure everyone stays informed while we address the underlying system issues."
106,CWA-281,"As a dispatcher in the gas trade, when I want to quickly accommodate surprising new customers with short-term needs to fill their own containers with gas in order to win the customer, I create dummy containers in the ERP system and coordinate with the freight forwarder and dispatcher to ensure they transport the actual containers correctly and capture the real container master data. I then update this information later to ensure data quality."
107,CWA-282,"As a logistics coordinator, when I need to deliver products to customers using their own containers, I manually enter dummy container equipment into the system to facilitate the initial filling process, ensuring smooth operations despite the lack of automated support."
108,CWA-283,"As a gas delivery employee, when automated cross-departmental prepayment processing fails, I revert to the outdated manual process to ensure that gas deliveries continue without interruption."
109,R34,"As a logistics coordinator, when buffer times for order delivery and shipping are not adhered to, resulting in delays, I now set stricter deadlines for production orders based on customer requested dates to ensure timely shipments."
