Since i cannot see if they are on the way already, I fetch them from the warehouse myself as a workaround, in order to prevent halting the production line. I tolerate, that I might end up with double the amount of material.",
65,K29,"As a logistics coordinator, I regularly struggle with material that is not delivered on time. This prevents a planned wave of required materials from getting released automatically. Since the system retries to release the wave only for 24 hours, I manually release all blocked waves every morning, to at lease provide the available material to the production lines.",
67,K31,"As a logistics worker, when there are no valid data for categorizing new materials in the new central warehouse, I automatically assign items to an A-B-C category. This should be classified automatically, but the automatism has no data in a new warehouse. The classification may be wrong, but it is mandatory to guarantee access to the material ",

97,R25,"As a shipping employee, I sometimes create photo documentation based on my intuition for certain shipments when customers have special requirements (packaging regulations, labels from the customer's number range, etc.) or if there have been inquiries from the customer regarding the packaging in the past. This protects me against vague accusations from customers and safeguards the company against liability claims in the event of transport damage.",
98,R26,"As a shipping employee, I am sometimes confused by packaging specifications. My intuition for the right packaging feels better than the specification in the system. I then consult by email or phone on the spot to avoid damaged products (depending on the shipping route, product, and customer specification), save costs, and act sustainably (cardboard instead of wood).",

Hence, I've set up emergency internet access through LTE hotspots and StarLink to maintain access to the Internet, Teams, and SharePoint, despite facing challenging situations where, at one location, windows must remain open because their coating blocks wireless signals when closed, forcing staff to work in cold conditions.",
111,SEC-34,"As an IT administrator, I faced an unexpected incident that affected our systems. Hence, I repurposed newly purchased servers, which were originally intended for our company's AI project, to establish emergency operations that remained in place until mid-February. This delayed the start of the AI project, but it was necessary to ensure the company's operations continued without interruption.",
112,SEC-35,"As an IT administrator, during a cyber incident, I struggled with maintaining printing capabilities in a potentially compromised network segment. Hence, I set up individual computers as print stations by connecting printers via USB cables to ensure that purchasing, production, and administration departments could continue their work.",

115,LIT-2,"As a hospital staff member responsible for taking patient measurements, I faced strict requirements to register results directly in the Hospital Information System (HIS) immediately after each measurement. However, this process was time-consuming and inefficient, especially during busy hours. Hence, I opted to take measurements from multiple patients in succession and then wrote the results down on a note before entering all the patient data into the HIS as a batch. This deviation allowed me to manage my workload more effectively, despite not following the prescribed protocol.","van der Waal et al. (2022): The SWORD is Mightier than the Interview: A Framework for Semi-automatic WORkaround Detection, https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/423163/SWORD.pdf?sequence=1"
116,LIT-3,"As a physician at ALPHA, I am required to use the hospital information system (HIS) to manage electronic health records (EHR). However, due to the constraints of the system and privacy policies, I often find it necessary to share EHR with colleagues outside of the hospital and copy them to my private devices. The challenge is that while I am aware of the risks and rules prohibiting this behavior, the demand for timely documentation and collaboration compels me to seek alternative methods. My goal is to ensure proper care and collaboration while managing the limitations imposed by the HIS.","Wiesche et al. (2024): Digital Desire Paths: Exploring the Role of Computer Workarounds in Emergent Information Systems Design, https://doi.org/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2313537"
117,LIT-4,"As a busy physician, I find that during the day, I am unable to document my interactions with patients due to time constraints. To manage my workload, I copy electronic health records (EHR) to personal USB devices, so I can work on them from home after hours. This workaround allows me to maintain a work-life balance, as I can document my work while spending time with my family. Although this violates the hospital's privacy policy, the urgency of patient care documentation drives this behavior. To address the risks associated with EHR sharing, I utilize a feature known as the VIP flag within the HIS. This tool allows me to mark particularly sensitive patient records so that both I and my colleagues ensure those records remain within the hospital system. The challenge lies in balancing the urgency of documentation with the need for privacy. This workaround directly supports the goal of reducing privacy breaches while enabling efficient communication among physicians regarding sensitive information.","Wiesche et al.

118,LIT-5,"During my time as an engineer at BETA, I encountered a tedious requirement to log in and out of my workstation throughout the day. Instead, I opted to simply log in each morning and log out at the end of the day. This workaround allowed for greater efficiency in my workflow, although it did mean that my workstation was left vulnerable during the day, which raised security concerns from the IT department. My objective was to focus on my projects and streamline my access to necessary resources.","Wiesche et al.

119,LIT-6,"After new two-factor authentication measures were implemented at BETA, I discovered that a company ID card I had claimed as lost could still function as the second authentication factor in my PC. This realization made it feasible for me to bypass some of the security measures without being officially sanctioned and still use the new card for access control and in the cafeteria. While I understood the intention behind the security protocols, my focus on project deadlines led me to adopt this workaround. The main challenge is balancing security compliance with maintaining productivity.","Wiesche et al. (2024): Digital Desire Paths: Exploring the Role of Computer Workarounds in Emergent Information Systems Design, https://doi.org/10.1080/0960085X.2024.2313537"
120,LIT-7,"To circumvent the two-factor authentication process at BETA, my colleagues and I discovered a tactic to break or cut our ID cards, rendering them nearly invisible during inspections. This tactic allowed us to leave our workstations unlocked without raising suspicion, as the IT team merely conducted visual checks for unattended ID cards. While this behavior carries risks, ensuring our productivity by avoiding the repeated login process was of higher priority for us.","Wiesche et al.

127,LIT-17,"As a control room operater in a nuclear power plant, I ensure active cooling, to remove the heat generated by radioactive decay. For a planned reactor shutdown, back up diesel generators were designed to start up automatically in order to provide power to the instruments and main water circulation pumps, however they took over 60 seconds to reach full speed. Too long for the core to be without cooling. It was suggested that the steam turbines, which would continue to spin after a reactor shutdown, might generate enough electrical power as they were coasting down to run the main water circulation pumps while the back-up diesel generators were winding up, elegantly bridging the power gap and allowing us to maintain reasonable core temperatures.","Chernobyl – 30 years on, Loss Prevention Bulletin 251 October 2016"
