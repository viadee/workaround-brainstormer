Once an order is confirmed, the system automatically processes payments through a secure gateway. \n    The next step involves checking the inventory levels for the ordered items. If the items are in stock, a pick list is generated for the warehouse team, who then package the items for shipping. \n    The system notifies the shipping carrier to arrange for pickup or generates a shipping label for direct drop-off. \n    Finally, the customer receives an automated confirmation email with tracking information. \n    Throughout this process, any discrepancies, such as payment failures or inventory discrepancies, must be resolved swiftly to ensure customer satisfaction.\n    ",
