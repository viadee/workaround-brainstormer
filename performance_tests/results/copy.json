If a suitable time is found, \n    the appointment is set, and the patient is informed about pre-appointment procedures, such as fasting or medication adjustments. \n    Confirmation calls or texts are sent to the patient 24 hours before the appointment. If the patient needs to reschedule or cancel, \n    the receptionist updates the appointment in the system and offers alternative dates.\n    ",
